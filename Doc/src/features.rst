This page lists the low-level primitives that PyCryptodome provides.

You are expected to have a solid understanding of cryptography and security
engineering to successfully use them.

You must also be able to recognize that some primitives are obsolete (e.g. TDES)
or even unsecure (RC4). They are provided only to enable backward compatibility
where required by the applications.

A list of useful resources in that area can be found on `Matthew Green's blog`_.
