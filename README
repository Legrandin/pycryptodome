This is version 1.1 of the Python cryptography modules, a
collection of cryptographic code for the Python programming language.

	This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as MD5
and SHA), and various encryption algorithms (IDEA, DES, RSA, ElGamal,
etc.).  The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.  I
consider this section to be essentially complete, and the software
interface will almost certainly not change in an incompatible way in
the future; all that remains to be done is to fix any bugs that show
up.  If you encounter a bug, please inform me immediately.  If you
implement a new algorithm, please send me a copy.

	A sample usage of the MD5 module is:
>>> from Crypto.Hash import MD5
>>> hash=MD5.new()
>>> hash.update(message)
>>> hash.digest()
'\235\361\034\357\217MX\2246\226\367\366Ebx\326'

	A sample use of an encryption algorithm (IDEA, in this case) is:
>>> from Crypto.Cipher import IDEA
>>> obj=IDEA.new('This is a key456', IDEA.ECB)
>>> message="The answer is no"
>>> ciphertext=obj.encrypt(message)
>>> ciphertext
'\2325$\343=)d\341^\025<\344\013\204 T'
>>> obj.decrypt(ciphertext)
'The answer is no'

	One possible application of the modules is writing secure
administration tools.  Another application is in writing daemons and
servers.  Clients and servers can encrypt the data being exchanged and
mutually authenticate themselves; daemons can encrypt private data for
added security.  Python also provides a pleasant framework for
prototyping and experimentation with cryptographic algorithms; thanks
to its arbitrary-length integers, public key algorithms are easily
implemented.

tasks, join the python-crypto mailing list.  Point your Web browser to

TO INSTALL:

	You must already have Python installed to build the
cryptography modules since the buildkit script (which the Makefile
uses) is written in Python.  Be sure you ran the "libainstall" and
"inclinstall" targets when you built Python, which install various
libraries and *.h files needed to compile modified versions of the
Python interpreter.
	
	Once Python has been built and installed, this package can be
compiled.  Simply run "make" in the same directory as this file.  The
default setup is to compile the modules so they can be dynamically
linked into the Python interpreter when they're imported; edit
Setup.in and/or Makefile.pre.in if desired.  If you installed Python
in a non-standard location, you might want to call make like so:

    make -k installdir=/path/to/exec/prefix/when/i/installed/Python
	
	To verify that everything is in order, run "make test".  It
will test all the cryptographic modules, skipping ones that aren't
available.  If the test script reports an error on your machine,
please inform me immediately, because that means there's a serious bug
somewhere in the cryptographic routines.  (Alternatively, track down
the bug and send me a patch.)

	Running test.py without the --quiet argument will let you see
what it's doing, and will also run a crude benchmark to give you an
impression of the comparative speeds of the algorithms and feedback
modes.  

	To install the package under the site-packages directory of
your Python installation, run "make install" once you've run "make
test" successfully.

	If you have any comments, corrections, or improvements for
this package, please e-mail me at the address below, or send it to the
python-crypto mailing list at python-crypto@makelist.com .  Good luck!
