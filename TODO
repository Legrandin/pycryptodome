For 1.9alpha4:

* Add more tests for random pool code?

* Manual and Web page: point to SF project for bug reports

* Update the demos

* Update documentation (mention dodgy status of PublicKey code)

* Clean up markup in pycrypt.tex

* Reformat all the code to MEMS Exchange style

* Document the functions and macros for adding a new algorithm
    Hash functions:
  hash_init(), hash_copy(), DIGEST_SIZE, hash_update(), hash_digest()
    Block functions: 
  ...

* Provide drop-in support for extensions/drivers like
amkCrypto/mxCrypto. There should be some way to register these
drivers in your package, e.g. by defining a certain subdirectory
to be a place where pycrypto looks for these drivers at startup
time.

* Add a secure PRNG (Yarrow, maybe?)

* A secret sharing module should be added to Util or Protocols.
