Changes since 1.1a1
===================
	* Most importantly, the distribution has been broken into two
parts: exportable, and export-controlled.  The exportable part
contains all the hashing algorithms, signature-only public key
algorithms, chaffing & winnowing, random number generation, various
utility modules, and the documentation.

	The export-controlled part contains public-key encryption
algorithms such as RSA and ElGamal, and bulk encryption algorithms
like DES, IDEA, or Skipjack.  Getting this code still requires that
you go through an access control CGI script, and denies you access if
you're outside the US or Canada.

	* Added the RIPEMD hashing algorithm.  (Contributed by
Hirendra Hindocha.)

	* Implemented the recently declassified Skipjack block
encryption algorithm.  My implementation runs at 864 K/sec on a
PII/266, which isn't particularly fast, but you're probably better off
using another algorithm anyway.  :)

	* A simple XOR cipher has been added, mostly for use by the
chaffing/winnowing code.  (Contributed by Barry Warsaw.)

	* Added Protocol.Chaffing and Hash.HMAC.py.  (Contributed by
Barry Warsaw.)  

	Protocol.Chaffing implements chaffing and winnowing, recently
proposed by R. Rivest, which hides a message (the wheat) by adding
many noise messages to it (the chaff).  The chaff can be discarded by
the receiver through a message authentication code.  The neat thing
about this is that it allows secret communication without actually
having an encryption algorithm, and therefore this falls within the
exportable subset.  

	* Tidied up randpool.py, and removed its use of a block
cipher; this makes it work with only the export-controlled subset
available.

	* Various renamings and reorganizations, mostly internal.
	
Changes since 1.0.2
===================

	* Changed files to work with Python 1.5; everything has been
re-arranged into a hierarchical package.  (Not backward compatible.)
The package organization is:
Crypto.
	Hash.
		MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, HAVAL
	Cipher.
		ARC2, ARC4, Blowfish, CAST, DES, DES3, Diamond, 
		IDEA, RC5, Sapphire
	PublicKey.
		DSA, ElGamal, qNEW, RSA
	Util.
		number, randpool, RFC1751

        Since this is backward-incompatible anyway, I also changed
module names from all lower-case to mixed-case: diamond -> Diamond,
rc5 -> RC5, etc.  That had been an annoying inconsistency for a while.
	
	* Added CAST5 module contributed by <wiml@hhhh.org>.

        * Added qNEW digital signature algorithm (from the digisign.py
I advertised a while back).  (If anyone would like to suggest new
algorithms that should be implemented, please do; I think I've got
everything that's really useful at the moment, but...)

	* Support for keyword arguments has been added.  This allowed
removing the obnoxious key handling for Diamond and RC5, where the
first few bytes of the key indicated the number of rounds to use, and
various other parameters.  Now you need only do something like:

from Crypto.Cipher import RC5
obj = RC5.new(key, RC5.ECB, rounds=8)

(Not backward compatible.) 

	* Various function names have been changed, and parameter
names altered.  None of these were part of the public interface, so it
shouldn't really matter much.

	* Various bugs fixed, the test suite has been expanded, and
the build process simplified.

	* Updated the documentation accordingly.

Changes since 1.0.1:
====================
	
	* Changed files to work with Python 1.4 .

	* The DES and DES3 modules now automatically correct the
parity of their keys.
	
	* Added R. Rivest's DES test (see http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/destest.txt)

	Changes since 1.0.0:

	* REDOC III succumbed to differential cryptanalysis, and has
been removed. 

	* The crypt and rotor modules have been dropped; they're still
available in the standard Python distribution. 

	* The Ultra-Fast crypt() module has been placed in a separate
distribution; see <http://starship.skyport.net/crew/amk/maintained/crypto.html>.  

	* Various bugs fixed.
